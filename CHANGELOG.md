#### 🧰 Reusable Browser Automation Utilities ✅ (Phase 2 Complete)

**Date:** 2025-10-03

Successfully extracted and migrated domain-agnostic utilities from application-level projects into the core playwrightauthor library for reuse across multiple projects.

- **Helper Utilities Module** (`playwrightauthor.helpers`):
  - `AdaptiveTimingController` - Adaptive timing control based on success/failure patterns
    - Dynamically adjusts wait times and timeouts based on success/failure
    - Speeds up after 3 consecutive successes (20% faster wait, 10% faster timeout)
    - Slows down immediately on failure (2x wait time and timeout)
    - Respects minimum/maximum bounds for safety (0.5s-5s wait, 10s-60s timeout)
    - **Use case:** Handling flaky UIs with variable response times
  - `scroll_page_incremental()` - Incremental scrolling for infinite-scroll pages
    - Supports both container and window scrolling with automatic fallback
    - Configurable scroll distance (default 600px)
    - **Use case:** Ensuring all content loads on infinite-scroll pages
  - `extract_with_fallbacks()` / `async_extract_with_fallbacks()` - Content extraction with fallback selectors
    - **Both sync and async versions** available for different contexts
    - Try multiple CSS selectors in order until one succeeds
    - Optional validation function for extracted content
    - Supports extracting inner_text, inner_html, or text_content
    - **Use case:** Robust content extraction when UI structure varies

- **HTML Utilities Module** (`playwrightauthor.utils.html`):
  - `html_to_markdown()` - Convert HTML to clean Markdown using html2text
    - Configurable options for links, images, and line wrapping
    - Clean whitespace handling and excessive blank line removal
    - Unicode support with smart character handling
    - **Use case:** Converting scraped HTML to readable Markdown for logging/storage

- **Documentation & Guidelines**:
  - `SYNC_ASYNC_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for sync/async API strategy ✅ NEW
    - Decision matrix for when to provide sync, async, or both APIs
    - Classification of all utilities with rationale
    - Implementation patterns and testing strategies
    - Common pitfalls and best practices
    - Migration examples from sync to async

- **New Dependency**:
  - Added `html2text>=2025.4.15` for HTML to Markdown conversion

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
  - 22 new unit tests for helper utilities ✅
  - 100% pass rate on all new tests
  - Test coverage for edge cases, error conditions, and normal operation
  - Tests for: adaptive timing speed-up/slow-down, HTML conversion options, line wrapping, Unicode handling

### Changed

- Updated `utils/__init__.py` to export new html utilities alongside existing logger and path utilities
- Code formatting improvements via ruff (import ordering, line length)
- Type hints modernized to use `collections.abc.Callable` instead of `typing.Callable`

### Planned Improvements (Phase 7)

**Opportunities for Dependent Projects**:

See PLAN.md Phase 7 for detailed improvement opportunities. Key highlights:

- **playpi**: Replace hardcoded sleep() calls with AdaptiveTimingController for 30-50% faster execution on responsive networks
- **playpi**: Consolidate ~150 lines of duplicate selector fallback logic using async_extract_with_fallbacks
- **virginia-clemm-poe**: Add markdown logging for 50% faster debugging with readable error snapshots
- **All projects**: Shared error capture patterns, performance profiling infrastructure, and reusable automation patterns

### Migration Notes

Projects using playwrightauthor can now import these utilities instead of maintaining their own copies:
- `from playwrightauthor.helpers.timing import AdaptiveTimingController`
- `from playwrightauthor.helpers.interaction import scroll_page_incremental`
- `from playwrightauthor.helpers.extraction import extract_with_fallbacks, async_extract_with_fallbacks`
- `from playwrightauthor.utils.html import html_to_markdown`

See migration example in playpi project.

### Added

#### 🚀 Chrome for Testing Exclusivity & Session Reuse ✅ MAJOR ENHANCEMENT

- **Exclusive Chrome for Testing Support**:
  - PlaywrightAuthor now exclusively uses Chrome for Testing (not regular Chrome)
  - Google has disabled CDP automation with user profiles in regular Chrome
  - Chrome for Testing is the official Google build designed for automation
  - Updated all browser discovery, installation, and launch logic to reject regular Chrome
  - Clear error messages explain why Chrome for Testing is required
  - Comprehensive permission fixes for Chrome for Testing on macOS (all helper executables)

- **Session Reuse Workflow**:
  - New `get_page()` method on Browser/AsyncBrowser classes for session reuse
  - Reuses existing browser contexts and pages instead of creating new ones
  - Maintains authenticated sessions across script runs without re-login
  - Intelligent page selection (skips extension pages, reuses existing tabs)
  - Perfect for workflows that require persistent authentication state

- **Developer Workflow Enhancement**:
  - New `playwrightauthor browse` CLI command launches Chrome for Testing in CDP mode
  - Browser stays running after command exits for other scripts to connect
  - Detects if Chrome is already running to avoid multiple instances
  - Enables manual login once, then automated scripts can reuse the session
  - Example workflow:
    1. Run `playwrightauthor browse` to launch browser
    2. Manually log into services (Gmail, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)
    3. Run automation scripts that use `browser.get_page()` to reuse sessions

### Fixed

- **Chrome Process Management** (2025-08-06):
  - Now automatically kills Chrome for Testing processes running without debug port and relaunches them
  - Removed the requirement for users to manually close Chrome when it's running without debugging
  - `ensure_browser()` now properly launches Chrome after killing non-debug instances
  - Fixed `launch_chrome()` and `launch_chrome_with_retry()` to properly return the Chrome process
  - This ensures automation always works without manual intervention and browser status can be verified

- **Chrome for Testing Installation**:
  - Fixed critical issue where Chrome for Testing lacked execute permissions after download
  - Added comprehensive permission setting for all executables in Chrome.app bundle
  - Fixed helper executables (chrome_crashpad_handler, etc.) permission issues
  - Resolved "GPU process isn't usable" crashes on macOS

### Changed

- **Browser Discovery**: Removed all regular Chrome paths from finder.py
