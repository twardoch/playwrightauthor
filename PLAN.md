  - ✅ Chrome executable location caching in state manager
  - ✅ Lazy browser initialization in context managers

- **Connection Optimization** ✅:
  - ✅ Connection health checks with comprehensive CDP diagnostics
  - ✅ Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
  - ✅ Enhanced debugging info and error messages for connection issues
  - ✅ New `connection.py` module with `ConnectionHealthChecker` class

### Priority 3: Advanced Features (FUTURE)

**Objective**: Add power-user features while maintaining simplicity.

- **Browser Profiles**:
  - Support multiple named profiles
  - Profile import/export functionality  
  - Profile encryption for sensitive data

- **Plugin Architecture**:
  - Design plugin system for extensibility
  - Create base plugin class with lifecycle hooks
  - Implement example plugins (proxy, headers, etc.)

- **Connection Pooling**:
  - Implement CDP connection pooling
  - Reuse browser contexts when possible
  - Add rate limiting for resource protection

## Phase 4: User Experience & Documentation (MAJOR PROGRESS)

This phase focused on making the library delightful to use.

### 1. Enhanced CLI ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED

  - ✅ `playwrightauthor diagnose` - Comprehensive troubleshooting and health checks
  - ✅ `playwrightauthor version` - Version and system information
  - ✅ `playwrightauthor clear-cache` - Clear browser data (existing)
  - ✅ `playwrightauthor status` - Browser status checks (existing)

- **Output Formatting** ✅:
  - ✅ Rich table formatting with colors and styling
  - ✅ JSON output format support
