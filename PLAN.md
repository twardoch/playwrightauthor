  - Structured logging with correlation IDs and distributed tracing
  - Custom metrics collection with Prometheus/StatsD integration
  - Browser crash detection and automatic recovery
- **Scalability Features**:
  - Horizontal scaling support for multiple machines
  - Queue-based job processing with retry mechanisms
  - Resource quotas and rate limiting per profile/user
- **Implementation**: `src/playwrightauthor/enterprise/` with monitoring, pooling, and scaling modules
