# Plan for Improvements

This document outlines the next phase of development for `PlaywrightAuthor`, focusing on making the library more robust, cross-platform, elegant, performant, and user-friendly.

## Phase 1: Robustness and Error Handling

This phase will focus on making the library more resilient to failure.

1.  **Refine Browser Management Logic**:
    *   Add more robust error handling to the `browser_manager.py` module. This includes handling cases where the LKGV JSON is unavailable or malformed, or when the browser download fails.
    *   Implement a retry mechanism for network requests.
    *   Add a timeout to the `subprocess.Popen` call to prevent hangs.
    *   Improve the process-killing logic to be more reliable across platforms.

2.  **Improve Onboarding**:
    *   The `onboarding.py` module should be able to detect when the user has successfully logged in. This could be done by checking for the presence of a specific cookie or by looking for a change in the page title or URL.
    *   The onboarding page should provide more detailed instructions to the user.

3.  **Add More Tests**:
    *   Add unit tests for the utility functions in `utils/`.
    *   Add more comprehensive integration tests that can be run in a controlled environment (e.g., using a Docker container). This will involve mocking the user interaction.

## Phase 2: Cross-Platform Compatibility

This phase will ensure that the library works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1.  **Test on All Platforms**:
    *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline that runs the tests on all three major platforms.
    *   Identify and fix any platform-specific bugs.

2.  **Refine Installation Logic**:
    *   The browser installation logic needs to be thoroughly tested on all platforms.
    *   The `_find_chrome_executable` function should be updated to handle different installation locations on each platform.

## Phase 3: Elegance and Performance

This phase will focus on improving the design and performance of the library.

1.  **Refactor `browser_manager.py`**:
    *   The `browser_manager.py` module is currently a bit monolithic. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused modules.
    *   The code should be made more readable and maintainable.

2.  **Optimize Performance**:
    *   The browser launch process should be optimized to be as fast as possible.
    *   The library should be benchmarked to identify any performance bottlenecks.

## Phase 4: User-Friendliness

This phase will focus on making the library easier to use.

1.  **Improve CLI**:
    *   The CLI should be made more user-friendly. This includes adding more commands, improving the help messages, and providing better error messages.
    *   Add a command to clear the browser's cache and user data.

2.  **Improve Documentation**:
    *   The `README.md` file should be updated to include more detailed instructions and examples.
    *   The API documentation should be improved to be more comprehensive.
    *   Add a "troubleshooting" section to the documentation.
