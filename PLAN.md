  - Design plugin system for extensibility
  - Create base plugin class with lifecycle hooks
  - Implement example plugins (proxy, headers, etc.)

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Objective**: Reduce startup time and resource usage.

- **Lazy Loading**:
  - Defer Playwright imports until needed
  - Implement lazy browser initialization
  - Cache Chrome executable location

  - Implement CDP connection pooling
  - Reuse browser contexts when possible
  - Add connection health checks

- **Parallel Operations**:
  - Enable concurrent page operations
  - Implement async batch operations
  - Add rate limiting for resource protection

### 3. Advanced Features

**Objective**: Add power-user features while maintaining simplicity.

- **Browser Profiles**:
  - Support multiple named profiles
  - Profile import/export functionality
  - Profile encryption for sensitive data

- **Session Management**:
  - Save/restore complete browser sessions
  - Session sharing between instances
  - Automatic session rotation

- **Advanced Authentication**:
  - OAuth flow automation
  - 2FA/MFA support helpers
  - Credential vault integration

## Phase 4: User Experience & Documentation (PLANNED)

This phase will focus on making the library delightful to use.

### 1. Enhanced CLI

**Objective**: Provide a powerful yet intuitive command-line interface.
