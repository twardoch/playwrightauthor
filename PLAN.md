# Development Plan for PlaywrightAuthor

This document outlines the remaining development priorities to achieve a complete, production-ready package.

## Current Status

PlaywrightAuthor v1.0.5 is a mature, feature-complete browser automation library with:
- ✅ Robust cross-platform browser management 
- ✅ State management and configuration systems
- ✅ Performance optimizations with lazy loading
- ✅ Comprehensive CLI interface
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and testing

## Remaining Priorities for 100% Completion
