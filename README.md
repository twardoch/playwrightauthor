# PlaywrightAuthor

*Your personal, authenticated browser for Playwright, ready in one line of code.*

PlaywrightAuthor is a convenience package for **Microsoft Playwright**. It handles the tedious parts of browser automation: finding and launching a **Chrome for Testing** instance, keeping it authenticated with your user profile, and connecting Playwright to it. All you need to do is instantiate a class, and you get a ready-to-use `Browser` object. This lets you focus on writing your automation script, not on the boilerplate.

The core idea is to let you do this:

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser

with Browser() as browser:
    # you get a standard Playwright browser object
    # that is already connected to a logged-in browser
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://github.com/me")
    print(f"Welcome, {page.locator('.user-profile-name').inner_text()}!")
```

    print(f"Page title: {page.title()}")

# Asynchronous API
async def main():
    print("\n--- Running Async Example ---")
    async with AsyncBrowser(verbose=True) as browser:
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://duckduckgo.com")
        print(f"Page title: {await page.title()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Common Patterns

### Authentication Workflow

The most common use case is automating authenticated services. PlaywrightAuthor makes this seamless by maintaining persistent login sessions:

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser

# First run: You'll need to manually log in
with Browser(profile="work") as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://mail.google.com")
    
    # If not logged in, the page will show the login screen
    # Complete the login manually in the browser window
    # PlaywrightAuthor will save the session for future runs
    
    print(f"Logged in as: {page.locator('[data-testid=user-email]').inner_text()}")

# Subsequent runs: Automatic authentication
with Browser(profile="work") as browser:
    page = browser.new_page() 
    page.goto("https://mail.google.com")
    # You're automatically logged in!
    inbox_count = page.locator('[data-testid=inbox-count]').inner_text()
    print(f"You have {inbox_count} unread emails")
```

### Error Handling and Retry Pattern

For production automation, implement robust error handling:

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser
from playwright.sync_api import TimeoutError
import time

def scrape_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
    """Robust scraping with automatic retry and error handling."""
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with Browser(verbose=attempt > 0) as browser:  # Enable logging on retries
                page = browser.new_page()
                
                # Set reasonable timeouts
                page.set_default_timeout(30000)  # 30 seconds
                
                page.goto(url)
                
                # Wait for content to load
                page.wait_for_selector('[data-testid=content]', timeout=10000)
                
                title = page.title()
                content = page.locator('[data-testid=content]').inner_text()
                
                return {"title": title, "content": content}
                
        except TimeoutError:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} timed out, retrying...")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            continue
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            continue
    
    raise Exception(f"Failed to scrape {url} after {max_retries} attempts")

# Usage
try:
    data = scrape_with_retry("https://example.com")
    print(f"Successfully scraped: {data['title']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Scraping failed: {e}")
```

### Profile Management for Multiple Accounts

Use profiles to manage multiple accounts or environments:

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser

# Define your environments
profiles = {
    "work": "work@company.com",
    "personal": "me@gmail.com", 
    "testing": "test@example.com"
}

def check_email_for_all_accounts():
    """Check email counts across all accounts."""
    results = {}
    
    for profile_name, email in profiles.items():
        try:
            with Browser(profile=profile_name) as browser:
                page = browser.new_page()
                page.goto("https://mail.google.com")
                
                # Each profile maintains its own authentication
                unread_count = page.locator('[aria-label="Inbox"]').get_attribute('data-count')
                results[email] = int(unread_count or 0)
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to check {email}: {e}")
            results[email] = None
    
    return results

# Usage
email_counts = check_email_for_all_accounts()
for email, count in email_counts.items():
    if count is not None:
        print(f"{email}: {count} unread emails")
    else:
        print(f"{email}: Failed to check")
```

### Interactive Development with REPL

Use the interactive REPL for development and debugging:

```bash
# Start the interactive REPL
python -m playwrightauthor repl

# In the REPL, you can interactively explore:
>>> page = browser.new_page()
>>> page.goto("https://github.com")
>>> page.title()
'GitHub: Let's build from here · GitHub'

>>> # Test selectors interactively
>>> page.locator('h1').inner_text()
'Let's build from here'

>>> # Run CLI commands without leaving REPL
>>> !status
Browser is ready.
  - Path: /Users/user/.playwrightauthor/chrome/chrome
  - User Data: /Users/user/.playwrightauthor/profiles/default

>>> # Switch profiles on the fly
>>> exit()  # Exit current browser
>>> browser = Browser(profile="work").__enter__()
>>> page = browser.new_page()
>>> page.goto("https://mail.google.com")
```

### Async for High Performance

Use AsyncBrowser for concurrent operations:

```python
import asyncio
from playwrightauthor import AsyncBrowser

async def scrape_multiple_pages(urls):
    """Scrape multiple pages concurrently."""
    
    async def scrape_single_page(url):
        async with AsyncBrowser() as browser:
            page = await browser.new_page()
            await page.goto(url)
            title = await page.title()
            return {"url": url, "title": title}
    
    # Run up to 5 concurrent scraping tasks
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)
    
    async def limited_scrape(url):
        async with semaphore:
            return await scrape_single_page(url)
    
    tasks = [limited_scrape(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    return results

# Usage
urls = [
    "https://github.com",
    "https://stackoverflow.com", 
    "https://python.org",
    "https://docs.python.org",
    "https://pypi.org"
]

async def main():
    results = await scrape_multiple_pages(urls)
    for result in results:
        if isinstance(result, dict):
            print(f"{result['url']}: {result['title']}")
        else:
            print(f"Error: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Best Practices

### Resource Management and Cleanup

Always use context managers to ensure proper resource cleanup:

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser

# ✅ GOOD: Context manager ensures cleanup
with Browser() as browser:
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    # Browser automatically cleaned up

# ❌ BAD: Manual cleanup required
browser = Browser().__enter__()
page = browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://example.com")
# Memory leak! Browser not cleaned up
```

**Page Lifecycle Management:**
```python
with Browser() as browser:
    # Create pages as needed
    page1 = browser.new_page()
    page2 = browser.new_page()
    
    # Close pages when done to free memory
    page1.close()
    page2.close()
    
    # Or use page context managers
    page = browser.new_page()
    try:
        page.goto("https://example.com")
        # Work with page
    finally:
        page.close()
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Large-Scale Automation:**

```python
from playwrightauthor import AsyncBrowser
import asyncio

async def optimize_for_performance():
    """High-performance automation patterns."""
    
    # Use connection pooling for multiple operations
    async with AsyncBrowser() as browser:
        # Reuse browser context across multiple pages
        context = await browser.new_context(
            viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 720},
            user_agent="Your-Bot/1.0"
        )
        
        # Concurrent page processing with rate limiting
        semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)  # Max 5 concurrent pages
        
        async def process_url(url):
            async with semaphore:
                page = await context.new_page()
                try:
                    await page.goto(url, wait_until="domcontentloaded")
                    # Process page content
                    title = await page.title()
                    return {"url": url, "title": title}
                finally:
                    await page.close()
        
        # Process multiple URLs concurrently
        urls = ["https://example1.com", "https://example2.com", "https://example3.com"]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[process_url(url) for url in urls])
        
        await context.close()
        return results

# Run the optimized automation
results = asyncio.run(optimize_for_performance())
```

**Memory Management:**
```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser

def memory_efficient_scraping(urls):
    """Process many URLs without memory leaks."""
    
    results = []
    with Browser() as browser:
        # Process in batches to control memory usage
        batch_size = 10
        for i in range(0, len(urls), batch_size):
            batch = urls[i:i + batch_size]
            
            for url in batch:
                page = browser.new_page()
                try:
                    page.goto(url, timeout=30000)
                    results.append({
                        "url": url,
                        "title": page.title(),
                        "status": "success"
                    })
                except Exception as e:
                    results.append({
                        "url": url, 
                        "error": str(e),
                        "status": "failed"
                    })
                finally:
                    page.close()  # Critical: free page memory
    
    return results
```

### Security Considerations

**Profile and Credential Management:**

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser
from pathlib import Path
import os

def secure_automation_setup():
    """Security best practices for browser automation."""
    
    # Use dedicated profiles for different security contexts
    profiles = {
        "production": "prod-automation",
        "staging": "staging-test", 
        "development": "dev-local"
    }
    
    environment = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
    profile_name = profiles.get(environment, "default")
    
    # Use environment-specific configuration
    with Browser(profile=profile_name, verbose=False) as browser:
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Set security headers if needed
        page.set_extra_http_headers({
            "User-Agent": "Company-Automation/1.0",
            "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"
        })
        
        # Navigate to secure endpoints
        page.goto("https://secure-api.company.com")
        return page.content()

# Environment-based configuration
def get_secure_config():
    """Load configuration securely from environment."""
    return {
        "timeout": int(os.getenv("AUTOMATION_TIMEOUT", "30000")),
        "headless": os.getenv("AUTOMATION_HEADLESS", "false").lower() == "true",
        "profile": os.getenv("AUTOMATION_PROFILE", "default")
    }
```

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser
import logging

# Configure logging to avoid sensitive data leaks
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('/var/log/automation.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

def secure_login_automation():
    """Handle authentication securely."""
    
    with Browser(profile="secure-profile", verbose=False) as browser:
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Navigate to login page
        page.goto("https://app.example.com/login")
        
        # Use environment variables for credentials (never hardcode)
        username = os.getenv("APP_USERNAME")
        password = os.getenv("APP_PASSWORD")
        
        if not username or not password:
            raise ValueError("Credentials not found in environment variables")
        
        # Fill credentials (never log sensitive data)
        page.fill('[name="username"]', username)
        page.fill('[name="password"]', password)
        
        # Log non-sensitive information only
        logging.info("Attempting login for user authentication")
        
        page.click('[type="submit"]')
        page.wait_for_url("**/dashboard")
        
        logging.info("Authentication successful")
        
        return page
```

### Configuration Management

**Production Configuration:**
```python
from playwrightauthor.config import PlaywrightAuthorConfig, BrowserConfig, NetworkConfig, LoggingConfig
from pathlib import Path

def create_production_config():
    """Production-ready configuration."""
    
    return PlaywrightAuthorConfig(
        browser=BrowserConfig(
            headless=True,  # No UI in production
            timeout=45000,  # Longer timeout for stability
            viewport_width=1920,
            viewport_height=1080,
            args=[
                "--no-sandbox",  # Required in containers
                "--disable-dev-shm-usage",  # Prevent memory issues
                "--disable-gpu",  # Not needed in headless
            ]
        ),
        network=NetworkConfig(
            retry_attempts=5,  # More retries for reliability
            download_timeout=600,  # 10 minutes for large downloads
            exponential_backoff=True,
            proxy=os.getenv("HTTPS_PROXY")  # Corporate proxy support
        ),
        logging=LoggingConfig(
            verbose=False,  # Reduce log noise
            log_level="INFO",
            log_file=Path("/var/log/playwrightauthor.log"),
            log_format="{time:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss} | {level} | {message}"
        ),
        enable_lazy_loading=True,  # Faster startup
        default_profile="production"
    )

# Apply production configuration
config = create_production_config()
from playwrightauthor.config import save_config
save_config(config)
```

**Environment Variables Setup:**
```bash
# Production environment setup
export PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_HEADLESS=true
export PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_TIMEOUT=45000
export PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_VERBOSE=false
export PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=5

# Credentials (never hardcode these)
export APP_USERNAME=your-automation-user
export APP_PASSWORD=secure-password-from-secrets-manager

# Network configuration
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

**Comprehensive Error Handling:**
```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser
from playwright.sync_api import TimeoutError, Error as PlaywrightError
import logging
import time

def robust_automation_with_error_handling():
    """Production-grade error handling patterns."""
    
    max_retries = 3
    base_delay = 1.0
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with Browser(verbose=attempt > 0) as browser:  # Enable logging on retries
                page = browser.new_page()
                
                # Set reasonable timeouts
                page.set_default_timeout(30000)
                
                # Navigate with error handling
                try:
                    page.goto("https://example.com", wait_until="networkidle")
                except TimeoutError:
                    logging.warning(f"Page load timeout on attempt {attempt + 1}")
                    if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                        continue
                    raise
                
                # Wait for specific elements with error handling
                try:
                    page.wait_for_selector('[data-testid="content"]', timeout=10000)
                except TimeoutError:
                    logging.error("Required content not found on page")
                    # Take screenshot for debugging
                    page.screenshot(path=f"error-{int(time.time())}.png")
                    raise
                
                # Extract data with validation
                title = page.title()
                if not title:
                    raise ValueError("Page title is empty")
                
                content = page.locator('[data-testid="content"]').inner_text()

## Command-Line Interface

PlaywrightAuthor comes with a comprehensive command-line interface for managing browsers, profiles, and diagnostics.

### Browser Management

```bash
# Check browser status and launch if needed
python -m playwrightauthor status

# Clear browser cache and user data
python -m playwrightauthor clear-cache

# Run comprehensive diagnostics
python -m playwrightauthor diagnose
```

### Profile Management

```bash
# List all browser profiles
python -m playwrightauthor profile list

# Create a new profile
python -m playwrightauthor profile create myprofile

# Show profile details
python -m playwrightauthor profile show myprofile

# Delete a profile
python -m playwrightauthor profile delete myprofile

# Clear all profiles
python -m playwrightauthor profile clear
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Show current configuration
python -m playwrightauthor config show

# Show version and system information
python -m playwrightauthor version
```

All commands support `--json` output format and `--verbose` for detailed logging.

## Developer workflow

1. **Read** `WORK.md` & `PLAN.md` before touching code.

2. **Iterate** in minimal, self‑contained commits.

3. After Python changes run:

   ```bash
   fd -e py -x uvx autoflake -i {}; \
   fd -e py -x uvx pyupgrade --py312-plus {}; \
   fd -e py -x uvx ruff check --output-format=github --fix --unsafe-fixes {}; \
   fd -e py -x uvx ruff format --respect-gitignore --target-version py312 {}; \
   python -m pytest
   ```

4. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, tick items in `TODO.md`, push.

5. Always finish a work session with **“Wait, but”** → reflect → refine → push again.

## Key Components

### Core API
The library exposes a minimal, clean API through two main classes:
- `Browser()` - Synchronous context manager
- `AsyncBrowser()` - Asynchronous context manager

Both provide identical functionality and return standard Playwright browser objects.

### Browser Management
- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds Chrome installations across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Smart Installation**: Downloads Chrome for Testing when needed using official Google endpoints
- **Process Management**: Handles Chrome launching with debug port and graceful cleanup
- **Profile Persistence**: Maintains user authentication across sessions

### Configuration System
- **Environment Variables**: `PLAYWRIGHTAUTHOR_*` prefix for all settings
- **State Management**: Caches browser paths and configuration for performance
- **Profile Support**: Multiple named profiles for different use cases

## Troubleshooting

### `BrowserManagerError: Could not find Chrome executable...`

This error means that `playwrightauthor` could not find a Chrome executable on your system. You can either install Chrome for Testing using the `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome` command, or install Google Chrome and ensure it is in a common system location.

### `playwright._impl._api_types.Error: Target page, context or browser has been closed`

This error usually means that the browser was closed while your script was running. This can happen if you manually close the browser window, or if the browser crashes. If you are running into this issue, you can try running your script with the `--verbose` flag to get more information.

Wait, but…

**Reflection & tiny refinements**

* Refocused the entire project from a specific scraper to a general-purpose Playwright convenience library.
* The core API is now class-based (`Browser`, `AsyncBrowser`) for a more Pythonic feel.
* Updated the file layout (`author.py`) and CLI (`status` command) to match the new scope.
* Generalized the onboarding HTML to be site-agnostic.
* Ensured all snippets and explanations align with the new vision of providing a zero-setup, authenticated browser.
