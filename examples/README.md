## First Time Setup

1. Install PlaywrightAuthor:
   ```bash
   pip install playwrightauthor
   ```

2. Run any example script:
   ```bash
   python examples/scrape_github_notifications.py
   ```

3. **On first run:** A browser window will open. Log into the service (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.) using your credentials.

4. **Subsequent runs:** The script will use your saved session automatically - no login required!

## Tips

- Use `Browser(verbose=True)` for debugging connection issues
- Your login sessions are stored locally and persist between runs
- Different profiles can be used for different accounts: `Browser(profile="work")`
- Sessions are stored in platform-specific locations (e.g., `~/.playwrightauthor/` on macOS/Linux)
