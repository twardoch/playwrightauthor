> ‚è∫ Perfect! It worked. The initial proof-of-concept demonstrated that we can connect to an existing Chrome instance and automate it.

Now, let's build this into a general-purpose Python package called `playwrightauthor`.

The goal is to create an easy-to-use library that allows developers to get a ready-to-use, authenticated Playwright `Browser` object with minimal effort. The user should be able to write simple, expressive code like this:

```python
from playwrightauthor import Browser

with Browser() as browser:
    # ... do Playwright stuff here ...
```

Behind the scenes, the package will handle all the complex setup:

1.  **Browser Management:**
    *   Check if a compatible **Chrome for Testing** is installed. If not, automatically download and install it. The primary method should be `npx puppeteer browsers install`, with a fallback to parsing the official JSON feeds.
    *   The browser should be stored in a user-specific, cross-platform cache directory (using `platformdirs`).
    *   Launch the browser with the `--remote-debugging-port` enabled. If a non-debugging instance is already running, it should be terminated and restarted correctly.

2.  **Authentication & Onboarding:**
    *   The browser must use a persistent user data directory to maintain login sessions across runs.
    *   On the very first run, or if the browser loses its authenticated state, the library should open a friendly HTML splash screen. This page will instruct the user to log into any necessary websites in that browser window.

3.  **Playwright Integration:**
    *   The core of the package will be the `Browser` and `AsyncBrowser` classes.
    *   These classes, when instantiated (ideally in a `with` statement), will perform the connection to the running browser instance via its remote debugging port (`playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp`).
    *   They will return a fully functional Playwright `Browser` object that the user can immediately start working with.

4.  **User Experience:**
    *   The entire process should feel magical. The user shouldn't need to know about debugging ports, browser paths, or user data directories.
    *   Provide a simple CLI for basic status checks (e.g., `python -m playwrightauthor status`).

This approach transforms the initial scraper concept into a powerful, reusable tool that simplifies the most common and frustrating part of browser automation: setup and authentication.
